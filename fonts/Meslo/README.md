## Which Font Should I Pick?

### Quick TL;DR

* **Monospaced terminal-friendly:** choose `Nerd Font Mono` (NFM)
* **Bigger icons (\~1.5x letter width):** pick `Nerd Font` (NF)
* **GUI/proportional contexts:** pick `Nerd Font Propo` (NFP)

### Ligatures

* Ligatures are preserved in patched fonts (v2.1.0+).
* If your terminal supports ligatures and you donâ€™t want them, disable them in your terminal settings.

## How to Install Fonts (User-Wide)

Weâ€™ve made this **easy-peasy** ðŸ˜Ž with `install.sh` â€” just drop it in the same folder as the `.ttf` files and run:

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

This script will:

1. Copy all `.ttf` files into your personal font folder: `~/.local/share/fonts`
2. Refresh your font cache automatically (`fc-cache -fv`)
3. Make Meslo Nerd Font available to your terminal or GUI apps

**Optional:** if you want system-wide installs, move the `.ttf` files into `/usr/share/fonts/` with `sudo`, then refresh the cache.

### How to Use in Your Terminal

1. Open your terminal â†’ Preferences â†’ Profile â†’ Text â†’ Custom Font
2. Pick `MesloLGS NF` as the font family
3. Restart the terminal for Starship / Powerlevel10k icons to show correctly
